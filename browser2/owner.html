<p><font color="#ffffff">Bob was on the state board for 2 terms, president for one.

<p><font color="#ffffff">In the&nbsp;early 1990's&nbsp;Bob's daughter Jessica Gieske, along with&nbsp;her husband Victor,&nbsp;took over the schools and salon. They are not only the 3rd generation of owners of these schools and salons, but the 3rd generation of licensed&nbsp;cosmetologists and instructors. In this day and age of corporate ownership of schools it's very rare to find schools where the owners are not only licensed instructors, but work day to day teaching their students, and ensuring their success. As a student there is security knowing the owners are working for their success, and won't do a &quot;corporate downsize&quot; if the profits aren't high enough.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff">Jes is a licensed Cosmetologist and Instructor,&nbsp;has a BBA from WMU, and is a Certified Massage Therapist with over 600 hours of training. She is a former massage school owner and instructor, and currently oversees the Spa curriculum and classes at the school. She owns Jessica's Salon &amp; Spa in&nbsp;Battle Creek, a successful boutique salon in town.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff">Vic is a licensed Cosmetologist and Instructor, and majored in business and accounting in college. He is our Financial Aid Officer, and attends the annual Region V Financial Aid seminars to keep fully abreast of the latest changes in the federal programs. He ensures that each student receives the most federal aid possible! He is also well versed in the NACCAS, Federal &amp; State regulations that apply to cosmetology schools.</font></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
